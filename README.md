# KK_VRHeadSizeAdjust v1.0.0

## Introduction
Adds new slider to Chara Maker body menu for setting head size only in VR.

Sometimes characters in Koikatsu may look a bit like sports mascots once you view them in VR, even if they look okay in 2D. This plugin allows for a quick fix using a simple slider.

### Compatible with:
* Koikatu
* KoikatuVR
* Koikatsu Party
* Koikatsu Party VR

## Requirements
* [BepInEx 5.4.8](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) or later
* [BepisPlugins r16.2.1](https://github.com/IllusionMods/BepisPlugins/releases) or later
* [KKAPI 1.18](https://github.com/IllusionMods/IllusionModdingAPI/releases) or later

## Installation
Extract the `BepInEx` folder and paste it into your base `Koikatu` folder (it should merge with the `BepInEx` folder that's already there!)

## Usage
Navigate to the body options menu in Chara Maker. You should see a toggle button to enable the feature. Enable the toggle and set the slider to your desired VR head size. The slider works in the same way as the normal "Head Size" slider. Save your card, and enjoy!
